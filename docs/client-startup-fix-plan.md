Plan for Fixing the Client Startup Issue
=========================================

Issue Summary:
--------------
When attempting to start the client, an error appears indicating that a module is missing ("Cannot find module 'tapable'") and there are “Invalid Version” errors. These problems suggest that some dependencies (or their versions/formatting) are not properly resolved. The plan below explains how to diagnose and correct these issues.

Steps to Fix:
-------------

1. Validate the Package Definition
   - Open the package.json file and ensure the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes, etc.).
   - Look for any version strings that might be malformed (e.g. extra spaces or missing quotes). Fix them as needed.

2. Add Missing Dependency (“tapable”)
   - The error “Cannot find module 'tapable'” indicates that html-webpack-plugin (used by react-scripts) cannot locate “tapable.”
   - Explicitly add tapable to the dependencies—for example, add:
     •   "tapable": "^2.2.1"
   - Insert the dependency into package.json under dependencies.

3. Remove Stale Dependencies
   - Delete the existing node_modules folder and any lock files (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to ensure a clean install.
     •   On Windows use:  
         rmdir /s /q node_modules  
         del package-lock.json
   - Clear the npm cache using:  
         npm cache clean --force

4. Reinstall Dependencies
   - Reinstall all dependencies using one of the following commands:
     •   Using npm:
             npm install --legacy-peer-deps
     •   (Alternatively, you can try Yarn:  
             yarn install  
         if npm continues to cause problems.)
   - Verify that the installation output completes without “Invalid Version” errors.

5. Verify and Test
   - Once installation finishes, start the client:
             npm start
   - Confirm that the client now starts without errors.

6. Follow-Up Checks
   - If errors persist, check whether html-webpack-plugin (bundled with react-scripts) is compatible with the installed version of tapable.
   - Inspect the versions of react-scripts and related Webpack dependencies in case an update is needed.
   - If a package manager still reports version errors, try using a different manager (such as Yarn) or ensure that you are using Node.js v18.17.1 as specified.

Key Code/Configuration Changes:
---------------------------------
•   In package.json (add tapable):
    
    {
      "name": "maze-game-client",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "private": true,
      "dependencies": {
        "react": "18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "18.2.0",
        "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
        "typescript": "4.9.5",
        "lodash": "4.17.21",
        "@types/lodash": "4.14.202",
        "@types/react": "18.2.0",
        "@types/react-dom": "18.2.0",
        "socket.io-client": "4.7.2",
        "tapable": "^2.2.1"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build"
      },
      "browserslist": {
        "production": [
          ">0.2%",
          "not dead",
          "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
          "last 1 chrome version",
          "last 1 firefox version",
          "last 1 safari version"
        ]
      }
    }

•   (Optional) Create an npm script to clean the install:
    
    "clean-install": "rmdir /s /q node_modules && del package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force && npm install --legacy-peer-deps"

Testing:
---------
After making these changes and reinstalling, run “npm start.” The client should now bootstrap without errors.

This plan should give your team clear, unambiguous instructions to resolve the startup issues.
